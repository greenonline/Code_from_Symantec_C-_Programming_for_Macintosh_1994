### Disk image

After uploading the source load I subsequently found a disk Image, on Macintosh Garden, [Symantec C++ Programming for the Macintosh](https://macintoshgarden.org/apps/symantec-c-programming-the-macintosh).

It should be noted that this appears to be the disk image for the *first edition* of the book. Whereas the code in this repo is from the *second edition* - I do not know if their are any significant differences.

I have "mirrored" the disk image in this directory.

Expand with StuffIt 5.5 (ignore any error dialogs) and open resulting image with Disk Copy 6.33
