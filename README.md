Note: Two directories are provided, both of which contain the same source code. One (`with_LF/`) contains source files using line feeds (LF) for reading on macOS/OS X, the other (`with_CR/`) uses carriage returns (CR) for Macintosh.

As there doesn't appear to be a copy of the disk that came with the book available on the web, at the time of writing, I thought that I would provide the code here. This is a "best guess" effort and may not be *exactly* the same as the original source disk, but the examples all compile and run (more or less).
